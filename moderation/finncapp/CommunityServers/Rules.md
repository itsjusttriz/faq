## Rules

| No.      | Text |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1      | Sharing the server details with non-approved community members will result in a ban from all servers **AND** the Stream.       |
| 2   | Check below to see a list of Staff in charge of each server.
| 3   | Anyone known to be performing/displaying/creating inappropriate structures/images/movements will be dealt with accordingly.        |
| 4   | For servers that provide and require them, overflow protection is a **MUST**.        |
| 5   | While it is not require, it is highly encouraged and appreciated for community members to contribute a little something to help out with server costs. While your fun and entertainment may be free, the servers are not.        |
| 6   | Having subscriber status does not provide immediate access to Community Servers. You must be a well-known and an approvably interactive member of this community.       |
| 7   | Failure to comply with these rules alongside any further ruling made by staff will result in a removal, be it the Community Server Discord role, access to the servers, access to the Discord or Twitch, or all of the above and further (depending on level of offense).       |
| 8   | This ruleset is subject to change at any given time. Be prepared. Be honorable. **BE GOOD!**       |
